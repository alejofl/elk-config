# Elastic Stack Configuration

This repository contains a tutorial and some configuration files for the Elastic Stack, which is a collection of open-source software produced by Elastic. The Elastic Stack is used for log analysis, data visualization, and data exploration. The Elastic Stack is composed of the following components:

* Elasticsearch: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
* Logstash: A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch.
* Kibana: A data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch.

The tutorial can be found in English and Spanish, in its respective directories.
